## Blog Endpoint

- **GET /rss-feed**: Content type must be 'application/rss+xml'. Delivers current RSS feed.
- **POST /blog**: Create a new blogpost if using authenticated client (takes title, slug, description/excerpt, and the content in markdown). The API would then upload it to a repository as an unpublished blogpost.

- **GET /blog/[slug]**: Gets specific blog post by slug.

Write simple short logs and upload them to a GitHub repository.

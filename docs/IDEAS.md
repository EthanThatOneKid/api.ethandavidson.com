# Ideas ðŸ§ 

## PokÃ©mon Endpoint

This endpoint would show my competitive teams and friend code to battle with.

## Discord Pusher Endpoint

This endpoint would proc a Discord bot to ping me a custom message.

## Official `api.ethandavidson.com` Client

This module will handle all of the request-fetching and contain the appropriate response typings.

## Error Handling

There needs to be a consistent way to manage errors.

## Wishlist Endpoint

This endpoint returns an array of WishItem objects that have the title, purchase link, and when I recieved the gift (once I get it).

## RSS Feed Endpoint

This endpoint returns an rss feed of content type 'application/rss+xml'. 
Sub paths can return the data of the feed in JSON.
